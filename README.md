# Spill the beans ü´ò

![home-page](./docs/screenshots/1.png)

Spill the beans is a simple secret-keeping app to store all your passwords!
I started developing this app because my dad asked for a place to store all his passwords, (that is why the only languages are english and italian, he can't speak english that well)
but since it is quite useful, I shared it.

#### Prs are welcome! ü•≥

The app features:
- [x] Strong password generation
- [x] Password management with encryption based on aes-256-cbc algorithm
- Basic customization (theme, profile picture, username)
- English and italian language
- [ ] Secure file containers
- [ ] Haveibeenpwned api to check if any password has been leaked

The ui is made with my personal component library [tredici](https://github.com/saverioscagnoli/tredici) ‚ú®
